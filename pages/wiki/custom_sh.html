<p>You will need to start by creating a file under <code>assets/syntax/</code> called something like <code>language-syntax.json</code>. This JSON file will define what regex syntax corresponds to what colour.</p>
<br>
<p class="alert">JVM Languages need a Java Plugin to function correctly, but some basic syntax highlighting can still be done.</p>
<br>
<p>Inside the JSON file, we need to define a few things. First, we need to tell the program what file extension to associate this json with. To do that, we give the key <code>"extension"</code> the value of the extension, so in the case of java files, this would be <code>"extension": "java"</code></p>
<br>
<p>Next, we need to define the path for the css. To do that, we add <code>"css_path": "styles/syntax/mylanguage"</code>. For example, for java, this would be <code>"css_path": "styles/syntax/java"</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, we can add the rules. To do that, create an array under the rules key: <code>"rules": []</code>, inside of which we can add our rules. To add a rule, we can open curly brackets, inside of which we need to define two values: <code>regex</code> and <code>type</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>In the regex key, we need to put the regular expression that matches the syntax rule. Make sure to escape any backslashes with a second backslash. (e.g. <code>"\"</code> becomes <code>"\\"</code>. For the type key, put the css class that corresponds to that regex. (e.g. <code>keyword</code>). For more infos about regex, you can go <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>We can add as many of these rules as we want, the syntax json for JSON files can be seen below:</p>
<pre class="code" plang="JSON">
{
    "extension": "json",
    "css_path": "styles/syntax/json",
    "rules": [
        {
            "regex": "\"(\\\\.|[^\"])+\"(?=\\s*:)",
            "type": "key"
        },
        {
            "regex": "(null|true|false|-?\\d+\\.?\\d*|\"(\\\\.|[^\"])+\")(?=\\s*[,}\\]])",
            "type": "value"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
